# tictactoe
Simple 2-player tic-tac-toe game in Python
This is a very simple implementation of a tic-tac-toe game. Pushing this to GitHub was mainly an exercise in getting familiar with Git.
That being said, I would like to come back to this when I'm more proficient with Python and implement some more features (such as a single-
player mode against an AI), however I also want to preserve it as it's the most complex coding challenge I've done so far and I'm proud
to see it working, and would love to have it there to compare my later projects against.
